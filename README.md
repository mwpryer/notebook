## Technologies

Built using TypeScript, Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS.

Bundling is done in the browser using the WASM version of [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/). Packages are fetched with a custom esbuild plugin and then cached in IndexedDB for performance using [localForage](https://localforage.github.io/localForage/). Local state is managed using [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) with a custom hook to easily get the execution context of the code cells.

UI Components were scaffolded using [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). The code editor is [@monaco-editor/react](https://github.com/suren-atoyan/monaco-react), a React wrapper for [monaco-editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/). The markdown editor is [@uiw/react-md-editor](https://uiwjs.github.io/react-md-editor/).
